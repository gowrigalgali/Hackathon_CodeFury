This will protect you from falling debris and injuries.\n\n2. Create a Safety Plan: Ensure you and your family have a safety plan that includes safe spots in your home, such as under heavy furniture or in doorways. Practice earthquake drills regularly to familiarize yourself with the procedures.\n\n3. Prepare an Emergency Kit: Keep a well-stocked emergency kit with essentials like water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, batteries, and a first-aid kit. Make sure to update the kit regularly and include supplies for each family member.`,
